She has published widely and is co-author of Rules of Play, The Game Design Reader, Quest to Learn: Growing a School for Digital Kids, and editor of The Ecology of Games, all from MIT Press. She has worked as a game designer for over 12 years and is a former co-editor of The International Journal of Learning and Media. Katie was an early advocate of the then-hidden world of machinima and continues to be interested in connections between game design, learning, and the transformational power of play.<br /><br />

Her non-profit ran an afterschool program focused on immersing middle school youth in game design, technology, and global collaborations via physical and mobile computing expertise, and she once co-designed a karaoke ice cream truck driven by a squirrel. Katie has been involved in the design of slow games, online games, mobile games, and big games in both the commercial and independent games sectors.
