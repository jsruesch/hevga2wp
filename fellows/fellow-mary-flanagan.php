          Mary Flanagan is a leading innovator, artist, educator and designer, whose works have included everything from game-inspired art, to commercial games that shift peopleâ€™s thinking about biases and stereotypes. Known for her theories on playculture, responsible design, and critical play, Flanagan has achieved international acclaim for her novel interdisciplinary work that includes a studio art practice and entrepreneurship alongside humanities scholarship and scientific inquiry. In 2015 Flanagan was awarded the Higher Education Video Games Alliance award for "advancing theory & research" in the field of game studies. In 2016 she was awarded the Vanguard award from Games for Change. Flanagan holds an honorary doctorate in design from the Illinois Institute of Technology and is the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities at Dartmouth College.
