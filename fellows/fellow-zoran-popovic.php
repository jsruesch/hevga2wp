          Zoran Popovic is a Professor and Director of Center for Game Science at University of Washington.  Trained as a computer scientist his research focus is on creating interactive engaging environments for learning and scientific discovery.  His laboratory created Foldit, a biochemistry game that produced three Nature publications in just two years, an a set of award-winning math learning games played by over eight million learners worldwide.  He is currently focusing on engaging methods that can rapidly develop experts in arbitrary domains ranging from K-12 to world-class domain experts.   His game-based Algebra Challenges conducted in Washington, Minnesota, and Norway, have shown that more than 96% of all children even in elementary school can learn key algebra concepts in just 1.5 hours.  His contributions to the field of interactive computer graphics have been recognized by a number of awards including the NSF CAREER Award, Alfred P.
