          <h4 class="text-lblue">High Employment Rates Among Alumni</h4>
          <p>
            Alumni of game-based programs fare well on the overall market. The
            percentage of alumni reporting gainful employment after a single
            year on the market was 93.1%, more than 8% higher than national
            employment rates for college graduates four years post graduation.
            More than half of alumni surveyed work within the video game industry
            (55.8%).
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h4 class="text-lblue">Contributions Beyond the Video Game Workforce</h4>
          <p>
            Game-based programs prepare students for more than just the games industry,
            however. While 55.8% of respondents work within the video game industry,
            the other 44.2% contribute to other vital industries, including education
            (26.8%), software development (5.8%), and government/security/defense
            (2.2%). Thus, a solid education in game design prepares students fo
            more than just the games industry itself.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h4 class="text-lblue">Well-Paying Jobs</h4>
          <p>
            Alumni of game-based programs also earn higher salaries. Graduates
            who participated in this survey earn an estimated average salary of
            $76,200 annually for full-time positions, or $24,000 more than the U.S.
            national average for college graduates with full-time jobs. Findings
            show little difference between the average salary for those working
            within the video game industry and those working outside of it, although
            graduate degree holders do significantly out-earn alumni with only
            undergraduate degrees.

          <h4 class="text-lblue">Higher Job Satisfaction</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, game-based program alumni report overall high rates of workplace
            well-being on the Cantril scale, with 82.9% classified as "thriving" out
            in the workplace. Additional items measuring autonomy, connectedness,
            sense of purpose, and satisfaction in career path and current employment
            context confirm these findings. Alumni working full-time reported even
            greater satisfaction than those working only part-time, and alumni working
            within the video game industry reported greater well-being than those
            working in other industries.

          <h4 class="text-lblue">Enrollment</h4>
          <p>
            The success of the video game industry begins with education. Enrollment
            of video game-related programs continues to grow, demonstrating the
            interest and strength in this course of study at universities and
            colleges nationwide and internationally.
            <br/>
            Responding game-based programs in higher education account for a total of
            7,675 undergraduate students in the United States and four other countries.
            Such programs are most commonly established within computer and information
            sciences (roughly 43,000 total undergraduate degrees per year in the States),
            engineering and engineering technologies (roughly 93,000 per year), and
            visual and performing arts (roughly 94,000).<sup>1<sup>

          <h4 class="text-lblue">Gender Diversity</h4>
          <p>
            Undergraduate video game programs show a notable level of diversity, by
            nearly a two to one margin, than other computer science and STEM-related
            programs. Key survey findings include:
            <br/>
            The average percentage of women in undergraduate programs is slightly
            more than 30%, with highest representation reported at 57% women.
            The average is nearly 33% at the graduate level. By contrast, women
            made up 17.6% of undergraduate and 28.2% of master’s degrees conferred
            in computer and information sciences, and 17.2% of undergraduate and 22.7%
            of master’s degrees in engineering and engineering technologies<sup>2</sup>. The
            involvement of female perspectives in the industry pipeline is especially
            relevant as women age 18 or older represent a significantly greater portion
            of the game-playing population (36%) than boys 18 or younger (17%), and
            the number of female gamers age 50 and older increased by 32% from 2012 to 2013.<sup>3<sup>
